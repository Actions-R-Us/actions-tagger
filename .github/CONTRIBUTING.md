## Maintainer Release Notes (shield your eyes :eyes:)
- Merge changes into the respective release branch
- Make other changes if necessary
- If this warrants a new release, then do the following
  - Bump version in `package.json` to next release version
  - Create a temporary branch which will contain `lib/index.js`
  - Run `npm run build` in that branch and commit the changes
  - Create a new release based on this temporary branch and add release notes
  - Delete temporary branch
- If the release branch is the latest
  - Merge release branch (`release/vX`) back into `master`
  - Append `-latest` to the version in `package.json` on `master`
